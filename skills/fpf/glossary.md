# FPF Glossary

Core terms of the First Principles Framework. Use these for FPF decomposition.

## Ontological Core (Part A)

| Term | Pattern | Definition |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Holon** | A.1 | Entity that is simultaneously a whole AND a part. Everything in FPF is a holon. |
| **BoundedContext** | A.1.1 | Semantic frame where terms have meaning. Meaning is LOCAL to context. |
| **System** | A.1 | Physical/digital entity that can bear roles and execute work. |
| **Role** | A.2 | A mask/identity that a System wears. Role != behavior. |
| **RoleAssignment** | A.2.1 | Links a System to a Role within a BoundedContext. |
| **MethodDescription** | A.3.2 | Design-time recipe (plan/algorithm/SOP). Lives in T^D (design-time). NOT execution. |
| **Method** | A.3.1 | Instantiated MethodDescription ready for execution. |
| **Work** | A.15.1 | Run-time occurrence. Actual execution that happened. Dated, consumes resources. IMMUTABLE. |
| **Transformer** | A.12 | Agent that takes input and produces output. External = tool. Reflexive = self-modification. |
| **Episteme** | A.0 | Knowledge artifact with carriers (files, models, beliefs). |

## Core Principles (Part A)

| Principle | Pattern | Definition |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Strict Distinction** | A.7 | Map != Territory. Never confuse plan with execution. MethodDescription != Work. |
| **Evidence Graph** | A.10 | All claims need auditable evidence chains. Cite sources. |
| **Ontological Parsimony** | A.11 | Do not multiply entities beyond necessity. |
| **Cross-Scale Consistency** | A.9 | Rules apply at all scales (micro to macro). |

## Reasoning (Part B)

| Term | Pattern | Definition |
|------|---------|------------|
| **Aggregation (Gamma)** | B.1 | How parts combine into wholes. Multiple types: Gamma_sys, Gamma_epist, Gamma_work. |
| **Trust Calculus (F-G-R)** | B.3 | Formality (how rigorous), Granularity/Scope (how broad), Reliability (how trustworthy). |
| **Evidence Decay** | B.3.4 | Evidence loses reliability over time. Epistemic debt accumulates. |
| **Canonical Evolution Loop** | B.4 | OBSERVE -> REFINE -> DEPLOY -> AUDIT cycle. |
| **Canonical Reasoning Cycle** | B.5 | Abduction (hypothesis) -> Deduction (predict) -> Induction (test). |
| **Abduction** | B.5.2 | Generate hypotheses from observations. Creative inference. |
| **Deduction** | B.5 | Derive conclusions from premises. Logical necessity. |
| **Induction** | B.5 | Generalize from specific cases. Probabilistic. |

## Constitution (Part E)

| Term | Pattern | Definition |
|------|---------|------------|
| **AutonomyBudget** | E.16 | Resource limits (tokens, tool calls, time). Check BEFORE execution. |

## FPF Search Keywords

Use ONLY these keywords with `fpf_search_index()`:

```
holon, system, episteme, role, method, work, trust, evidence,
transformer, reliability, aggregation, assurance, reasoning,
budget, context, deduction, induction, abduction, formality,
evolution, agent
```

DO NOT search for task-topic words (e.g., "AI agents", "web search"). 
FPF is a methodology, not a knowledge base about your task topic.
