Quick reference for essential patterns. Load full content from domain indexes when needed.

## A.7 Strict Distinction
**Domain**: foundations | **Path**: `fpf-core/foundations/A.7_strict_distinction_clarity_lattice.md`

Map != Territory. Plan (MethodDescription) != Execution (Work).
Never confuse what you plan to do with what actually happened.

## A.10 Evidence Graph
**Domain**: trust-evidence | **Path**: `fpf-core/trust-evidence/A.10_evidence_graph_referring_c4.md`

All claims need auditable evidence chains. Cite sources.
Every assertion should be traceable to its origin.

## B.3 Trust Calculus (F-G-R)
**Domain**: trust-evidence | **Path**: `fpf-core/trust-evidence/B.3_trust_assurance_calculus_fgr_with_congruence.md`

Assess reliability of sources and claims:
- **Formality**: How rigorous/formal is the source?
- **Granularity**: How specific/detailed is the information?
- **Reliability**: How trustworthy is the source?

## B.5 Reasoning Cycle
**Domain**: reasoning | **Path**: `fpf-core/reasoning/B.5_canonical_reasoning_cycle.md`

- **Abduction**: Generate hypotheses from observations (creative inference)
- **Deduction**: Derive predictions from hypotheses (logical necessity)
- **Induction**: Test predictions against evidence (probabilistic validation)
