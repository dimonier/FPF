# FPF Navigation Guide

## Preferred: Domain-Based Navigation

Navigate by domain for targeted pattern discovery:

| Need | Domain | Index Path |
|------|--------|------------|
| Understanding entities, roles | foundations | `fpf-core/foundations/index.md` |
| Planning, execution | transformation | `fpf-core/transformation/index.md` |
| Problem-solving, reasoning | reasoning | `fpf-core/reasoning/index.md` |
| Evidence, reliability | trust-evidence | `fpf-core/trust-evidence/index.md` |
| Composition, emergence | aggregation | `fpf-core/aggregation/index.md` |
| Interfaces, boundaries | signature | `fpf-core/signature/index.md` |
| Domain calculi | architheories | `fpf-core/architheories/index.md` |

## Alternative: Keyword Search

Use with `fpf_search_index()` when domain unclear:

```
holon, system, episteme, role, method, work, trust, evidence,
transformer, reliability, aggregation, assurance, reasoning,
budget, context, deduction, induction, abduction, formality,
evolution, agent
```

DO NOT search for task-topic words (e.g., "AI agents", "web search", "Python").
FPF is a METHODOLOGY for thinking, not a knowledge base about your task topic.
