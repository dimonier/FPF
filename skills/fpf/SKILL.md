# FPF Thinking Skill

FPF is an "Operating System for Thought" - a rigorous architecture for thinking that ensures auditable reasoning, evidence-based decisions, and clear distinction between plans and execution.

## Pattern Selection Logic

**Start here to find the right patterns for your task:**

### By Task Type

**Modeling & Design:**
- System modeling → **foundations** (A.1 Entity/Holon, A.2 Roles) → **transformation** (A.15 Role-Method-Work)
- Interface design → **signature** (A.6 Signature Stack, A.6.5 Slot Discipline)
- Boundary definition → **signature** (A.6.B Boundary Norms, A.6.C Contract Unpacking)

**Analysis & Evaluation:**
- Reliability/trust evaluation → **trust-evidence** (B.3 F-G-R Calculus, C.2.2 Reliability)
- Evidence validation → **trust-evidence** (A.10 Evidence Graph, B.3.4 Evidence Decay)
- Metric design → **architheories** (C.16 Measurement, A.18 CSLC)

**Problem-Solving:**
- Creative ideation → **reasoning** (B.5.2 Abductive Loop, C.17 Creativity-CHR)
- Systematic reasoning → **reasoning** (B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle)
- Conflict resolution → **ethics** (D.5 Bias-Audit)

**Composition & Integration:**
- Combining parts → **aggregation** (B.1 Gamma Operator, B.2 Meta-Holon Transition)
- Cross-domain mapping → **unification** (F.9 Bridges, F.7 Concept-Set Table)
- Method composition → **aggregation** (B.1.5 Γ_method)

**Process & Execution:**
- Task planning → **transformation** (A.15.2 WorkPlan, A.3.2 MethodDescription)
- Work execution → **transformation** (A.15.1 Work, A.3 Transformer Quartet)
- State modeling → **foundations** (A.2.5 RoleStateGraph, A.19 CharacteristicSpace)

### By Domain (Load Order)

**Most common progression:**
1. **foundations** → understand entities, roles, distinctions
2. **transformation** → plan and execute work
3. **trust-evidence** → validate with evidence
4. **reasoning** OR **aggregation** → problem-solve or compose

**Specialized needs:**
- **signature** → when defining interfaces/boundaries (often with foundations)
- **architheories** → when domain-specific calculi needed (C.2-C.25)
- **constitution** → when authoring FPF content (E.8, E.10)
- **unification** → when bridging contexts (F.9, F.18)
- **sota** → when benchmarking or discipline-specific work (G.0-G.13)

## Core Workflow (B.5 Canonical Reasoning Cycle)

For every task:

1. **OBSERVE**: Understand request → identify task type above
2. **SEARCH**: Use domain selection logic → load relevant domain index
3. **LOAD**: Read specific patterns identified in domain index
4. **PLAN**: Reference pattern IDs in reasoning (MethodDescription)
5. **EXECUTE**: Deploy plan (Work), maintain strict Object≠Description distinction (A.7)
6. **AUDIT**: Log evidence chains (A.10), reference source patterns

## Navigation Hub

**Master index:** [fpf-core/index.md](fpf-core/index.md) - domain overview with expanded guidance

**Domain indexes:**
- [foundations](fpf-core/foundations/index.md) - entities, roles, distinctions, characteristics
- [transformation](fpf-core/transformation/index.md) - methods, work, execution, evolution
- [reasoning](fpf-core/reasoning/index.md) - problem-solving, abduction, exploration
- [trust-evidence](fpf-core/trust-evidence/index.md) - F-G-R calculus, evidence graphs, reliability
- [aggregation](fpf-core/aggregation/index.md) - Gamma operator, meta-holon transitions, composition
- [signature](fpf-core/signature/index.md) - boundaries, interfaces, slot discipline, morphisms
- [architheories](fpf-core/architheories/index.md) - domain calculi (KD-CAL, Kind-CAL, etc.)
- [constitution](fpf-core/constitution/index.md) - FPF authoring rules, lexical discipline
- [unification](fpf-core/unification/index.md) - bridges, concept-sets, context mapping
- [ethics](fpf-core/ethics/index.md) - bias-audit, ethical assurance
- [sota](fpf-core/sota/index.md) - benchmarks, discipline packs, telemetry

## Starter Patterns

**Must-read for any FPF usage:**
- **A.1** - Holonic Foundation (entity composition)
- **A.7** - Strict Distinction (avoid category errors: Object≠Description, Role≠Work)
- **A.10** - Evidence Graph (traceability)

**Most common by domain:**
- foundations: A.1, A.2, A.7
- transformation: A.3, A.15, A.15.1 (Work)
- reasoning: B.5, B.5.2 (Abduction)
- trust-evidence: B.3, A.10
- aggregation: B.1, B.2
- signature: A.6, A.6.5

## Critical Disciplines

**Always apply:**
- **Strict Distinction (A.7)**: Object ≠ Description ≠ Carrier; Role ≠ Work; Method ≠ MethodDescription
- **Evidence chains (A.10)**: Every claim needs evidence reference
- **Scope discipline (A.2.6)**: Explicit context boundaries
- **Role-Method-Work alignment (A.15)**: Clear separation of intent, plan, execution
